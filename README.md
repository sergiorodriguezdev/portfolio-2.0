# Portfolio v2.0

## Description

I wanted to create a new portfolio to showcase my work and additional skills I have gained, such as the use of CSS frameworks. Even though I had already built a portfolio recently, I wanted to populate it with data automatically rather than manually update the HTML content.

This was a great opportunity to further learn Bootstrap and the JavaScript fetch API. It took plenty of trial and error to have a working end product but I feel I gained a lot of knowledge in the time I spent working on this.

## Credits

I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) exclusively as part of this project. Additionally, I am retrieving all repo data using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).

To create a hyperlink image overlay, I used the code found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) and made the necessary adjustments to fit my project.

## Future Development
- Add filtering options to the Portfolio section.
- Clean up and improve JavaScript code.
- Migrate off GitHub Pages.
- Add a "Contact Me" form.
